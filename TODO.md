1. ListView: Clicking a location on the list displays unique information about the location, and animates its associated map marker (e.g. bouncing, color change)

2. API requests: Data requests that fail are handled gracefully using common fallback techniques (i.e. AJAX error or fail methods). 'Gracefully' means the user isn’t left wondering why a component isn’t working. If an API doesn’t load there should be some visible indication on the page that it didn’t load. (try catch here like in Academy)

3. Readme: what is it, install, source, license

4. Focus: Focus is appropriately managed allowing users to noticeably tab through each of the important elements of the page. Modal or interstitial windows appropriately lock focus.

5. organized comps in "Components" folder

6. Service Workers: When available in the browser, the site uses a service worker to cache responses to requests for site assets. Visited pages are rendered when there is no network access.
